* I am using a Mac so I do not need to install OpenSSH but if you are using a Windows laptop, go to this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)

* Now, look up your [course-specific account ](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) for the course. You might have to change your password. My course specific account is cse15lwi22atw@ieng6.ucsd.edu

* Now, open a new terminal (Terminal -> New Terminal), and type the following code: 
> $ ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
